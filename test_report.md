## 1. Executive Summary
- **Objective:** To evaluate the User Management API in terms of functionality, security, and input validation.
- **Methodology:** Manual exploratory testing combined with automated testing using `pytest`.
- **Outcome:** Several critical authorization and security vulnerabilities were discovered, along with inconsistencies in pagination, sorting, and search behavior.

## 2. Test Scope & Approach
- **Scope:**
  - Core user management operations (`create`, `read`, `update`, `delete`).
  - Authentication and session handling.
  - Validation mechanisms (e.g., input constraints, search parameters).
  - Security aspects including authorization, password hashing, and information disclosure.
- **Out of Scope:**
  - Detailed performance/stress testing.
  - Deployment or infrastructure-related validations.
- **Approach:**
  - **Exploratory testing** to identify edge cases and misuse scenarios.
  - **Automated functional tests** with `pytest` to verify key API endpoints.
  - **Security-focused review** via code inspection and crafted requests.

## 3. Test Metrics
- Total test cases: 11
- Passed/Failed: 9/2
- Code coverage: N/A
- Basic performance testing: N/A (could be measured if needed)

## 4. Bug Summary
- Total bugs identified: 10+
- Severity distribution: Critical (1), High (3–4), Medium (3–4), Low (1–2)
- Categories affected: Security, Authorization, Validation, Logic, Concurrency

## 5. Recommendations
- Enforce strict owner/role-based authorization checks for `PUT` and `DELETE` endpoints.
- Enable proper session expiration checks.
- Replace MD5 hashing with stronger algorithms such as `bcrypt` or `argon2`, using random salts.
- Restrict detailed `/stats` output to administrators only, or remove sensitive fields entirely.
- Fix the pagination off-by-one issue and ensure `created_at` is sorted by actual datetime values.
- Tighten the username regex to allow only safe characters.
- Improve thread-safety by adding proper locking for write operations.
- Implement rate limiting based on trusted proxies and apply per-user/endpoint limits.
- Disable or secure `/users/bulk` with authentication and rate limiting.

## 6. Security Assessment
- High-risk vulnerabilities were identified, including data exposure in `/stats`, weak MD5-based password hashing, unauthorized updates/deletions, and tokens without expiry.
- **Impact:** These issues could lead to account takeover, data leakage, and abuse of the system.
- **Recommendation:** Prioritize fixes for authorization flaws, strengthen cryptographic practices, and enforce secure session handling. Additionally, implement logging/monitoring and data masking for sensitive fields.
